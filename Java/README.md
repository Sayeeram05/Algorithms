# Java Algorithms

This folder contains Java implementations of various algorithms, focusing on searching and sorting techniques. The purpose of these implementations is to provide practical examples of common algorithms used in computer science and software development.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Search
This subfolder contains Java programs that demonstrate different search algorithms. Examples include:

- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

### 2. Sorting
This subfolder includes Java programs that demonstrate various sorting algorithms. Examples include:

- **QuickSort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements by partitioning the array into smaller sub-arrays.

## How to Use
To use the programs in this folder:

1. Navigate to the desired algorithm's subfolder (e.g., `Search` or `Sorting`).
2. Review the source code for the algorithm's implementation.
3. Compile and run the Java programs using a Java Development Kit (JDK) to see the algorithms in action.
