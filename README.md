# Algorithm Repository

This repository contains various algorithms implemented in two programming languages: Python and Java. The repository is organized into separate folders for each language, with subfolders categorizing the algorithms by their type.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Python
The Python folder contains algorithms implemented in Python. It is further divided into two subfolders:

- **Sorting**: This subfolder includes various sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, and more.
- **Search**: This subfolder contains search algorithms, including Binary Search, Linear Search, and other search-related techniques.

### 2. Java
The Java folder contains algorithms implemented in Java. It is organized similarly into two subfolders:

- **Sorting**: This subfolder includes Java implementations of sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, and others.
- **Search**: This subfolder contains Java implementations of search algorithms, such as Binary Search, Linear Search, and more.

## How to Use
To explore the algorithms:
- Navigate to the `Python` or `Java` folder based on your preferred programming language.
- Inside each folder, you'll find subfolders for `Sorting` and `Search`.
- Browse the code files to study the implementation of each algorithm.
